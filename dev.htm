    	<p><a name="Alex" id="Alex"></a>My name is Erdenetuya Lkhagvadorj a graduate computer science student. I did my undergraduate studies at Mongolian University of Science and Technology in Computer Science. Now I'm doing my Masters at Cal Poly Pomona.
My area of interest lies in Artificial Intelligence. My undergraduate project topic was University Time Table Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm. I'm planning on doing more research on this topic for my Masters thesis.

In my free time, I enjoy watching stand up comedies, doing online-shopping and hanging out with my friends. </p>
