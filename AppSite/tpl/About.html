	Merging technology with education is one of the most important factors that affect the education process. Technology saves time and effort, and gives teachers the opportunity to utilize the class time. Our technology is called Uclick which is an android based mobile phone application that allows the students to interact through answering multiple choices questions using their phones. Since the regular clickers cost from 35$ to 40$, this application will make the clicker idea affordable for all the students. When a teacher displays a question and let the students answer that question using their phones, the teacher will get the students’ answers faster than collecting the answers’ sheets, and it will ease the statistics operations if the teacher needs some.
